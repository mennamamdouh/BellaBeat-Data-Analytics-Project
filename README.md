#### The analysis process went as the following: ####

  1. Asking phase:
  
      This phase included asking some questions we want to answer to achieve the business's goals through the data we collected.
  
  2. Preparing phase:
  
      This phase included searching for the data that would answer our questions, getting the data and choosing the right software that was suitable for our data.
      
      Here, I've used spreadsheets as the data was small and I was able to track it using sheets.
  
  3. Cleaning phase:
      This phase included filtering, removing duplicates, removing nulls, and extracting the data which would be useful for our analysis.
  
  4. Analyzing phase:
      This phase included thinking about techniques to extract the useful insights, organizing and aggregating data, performing calculations, and identifying trends and relationships.
  
  5. Sharing phase:
      This phase included determining the best visuals to share my findings and presenting the findings in the form of ppt file to get it accessible for the stakeholders.

  6. Acting phase:
      This phase included presenting my findings in a way my stakeholders understand.

#### Decisions needed to make according to the findings: ####

  1. Most of the users are healthy or overweight which makes BellaBeat to provide a regime and some tips that be suitable for them
  
  2. Users know how to sleep well, so BellaBeat can provide some additional information about sleeping or put their effort in other activities' tips
  
  3. Users like to walk during the daylight more than the night, so BellaBeat can take the advantage of this and send notifications to users to remind them with their walk time
