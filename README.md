# BellaBeat-Data-Analytics-Project
This project is about data analytics for health-and-fitness company BellaBeat.
The repository contains xlsx and ppt files, the first xlsx files is the raw data, the second is the filtered, sorted and final useful data, and the third one contains the extracted visualization. The ppt file is the final result for the analytics and contains the useful insights for the stakeholders.

The analytics process went as the following:
  1. Asking phase:
      This phase included asking the questions we want to answer to achieve the business's goals
  
  2. Preparing phase:
      This phase included searching for the data that would answer our questions, getting the data and choosing the right software that was suitable for our data. Here, I used spreadsheets as the data was small and I was able to track it using sheets.
  
  3. Cleaning phase:
      This phase included filtering, removing duplicates, removing nulls, and extracting the data which would be useful for our analysis.
  
  4. Analyzing phase:
      This phase included thinking about techniques to extract the useful insights, organizing and aggregating data, performing calculations, and identifying trends and relationships
  
  5. Sharing phase:
      This phase included determining the best visuals to share my findings and presenting the findings in the form of ppt file to get it accessible for the stakeholders.

  6. Acting phase:
      This phase included presenting my findings to my friends as my stakeholds =)
